# Project Overview

This project consists of two web applications:
1. **Personal Risk Diagnosis**
2. **Personal Type Diagnosis**

Each application is comprised of the following four pages:
- **Cover Page (`index.html`)**: Introduces the diagnosis, explains its features (e.g., instant diagnosis, free evaluation, etc.), and provides a "Start Diagnosis" button.
- **Loading Page (`loading.html`)**: Displays a loading screen (e.g., with a spinner and "Diagnosing..." message) after all quiz questions are completed, while results are being calculated. After a set wait time, it automatically redirects to the Results page.
- **Quiz Page (`quiz.html`)**: Presents the quiz questions.
  - For the Personal Risk Diagnosis, the quiz is a scored questionnaire.
  - For the Personal Type Diagnosis, there are 20 Yes/No questions with category headers (e.g., Family, Capital, Self, Risk) shown above each group.
  
  User responses are stored (using `localStorage` in the sample code) and, upon completion of the quiz, the user is redirected to the Loading page.
  
- **Results Page (`result.html`)**: Displays the diagnosis result based on the user's responses. For the Personal Risk Diagnosis, this is based on the total score; for the Personal Type Diagnosis, it shows one of 16 possible types. A "Back to LINE" button (with a LINE icon from Font Awesome) is provided for navigation back to the Cover page.

# Deployment Instructions

1. **Verify Files**:  
   Ensure that each project folder contains the following four HTML files: `index.html`, `loading.html`, `quiz.html`, and `result.html`.

2. **Zip the Folders**:  
   - On **Windows**: Right-click on each folder and choose "Send to" â†’ "Compressed (zipped) folder."
   - On **macOS**: Right-click on each folder and select "Compress."

3. **Share with the Engineer**:  
   Provide the ZIP files or upload the projects to GitHub. If using GitHub, share the repository URLs with the engineer so they can clone or download the project.

# Additional Notes

- **Browser Preview**:  
  Each HTML file can be opened directly in a web browser for testing.

- **Local Storage Usage**:  
  The quiz pages store user responses using `localStorage`. The Loading and Results pages retrieve this data. Adjust this mechanism if integrating with a backend.

- **External Resources**:  
  The applications use Google Fonts and the Font Awesome CDN. An active internet connection is required for these resources to load correctly.

- **Customization**:  
  The provided code is a sample. Feel free to modify colors, animations, or any other settings to meet your specific project requirements.
